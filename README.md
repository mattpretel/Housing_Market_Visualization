# Real Estate Data Visualization

In this project I will be creating a multitude of interactive Real Estate maps that we will sinc together into an interactive dashboard. Great to use for business analytics and visualization of complex data. 

In Housing Analytics I will use APIs to retrieve data for the SF housing market. After this I will create a series of interactive maps based on housing market and neighborhood statistics. 

Once the analysis is complete I will use a new notebook to create my dashboard (called "Dashboard"). Here I will define and create functions that will copy my Housing Analytics mapping into a dashboard where the user can interact with it all at one (best used with JupyterLab Light settings).
